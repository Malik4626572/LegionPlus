## Installation
To install Legion+, you may choose to either download the latest pre-compiled release from [the releases page](https://github.com/r-ex/LegionPlus/releases/latest), or compile the source code for yourself using the provided Visual Studio Solution file (.sln)

Compilation is currently only supported on Windows due to some platform-specific libraries that are required
